<p> This local server contains a brief exemplary of my understanding of node.js and express.js, as well as explanations to the aforementioned software. <br>
    With a lack of guidences and the minimal use of our limited teachings in practicality last semester, combined with the rapid learning and being older, makes these new topics fairly difficult, and requires a <b>TON</b> of self teaching, and learning by your own hand. <br>

    <br>

    I know this will be seen as excuses, and potentially couldn't give a fuck. I'm just stating facts and my opinion. I try my very best, and I will continue to progress. <br>
    I hope this webside will be adequate, I kept it simple and slick since it is similar to a report, I can add a bunch more styling if needed.<br>

    <br>

    In regards to heroku, I definitely need some guidance, as not even my class mates are able to figure out why I can't upload anything to it. Asked several other students.
