<br>

<div class="col-md-3">
<p> 
    Express.js is a Node js web application server framework, which is specifically designed for building single-page, multi-page, and hybrid web applications.

    It has become the standard server framework for node.js. Express is the backend part of something known as the MEAN stack.
    
    The MEAN is a free and open-source JavaScript software stack for building dynamic web sites and web applications which has the following components;
    
<ul>
    <li>1) MongoDB - The standard NoSQL database</li>
    
    <li>2) Express.js - The default web applications framework</li>
    
    <li>3) Angular.js - The JavaScript MVC framework used for web applications</li>
    
    <li>4) Node.js - Framework used for scalable server-side and networking applications.</li>
</ul>
    
    The Express.js framework makes it very easy to develop an application which can be used to handle multiple types of requests like the GET, PUT, and POST and DELETE requests.

    <h4> Installation </h4>
    <p>
        Express gets installed via the Node Package Manager. This can be done by executing the following line in the command line
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>npm install express</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        The above command requests the Node package manager to download the required express modules and install them accordingly.
    </p>

    <h4> Setup </h4>
    <p>
        We'll start of by creating our dependencies. These can be manually created through the package.json file, where you can adjust each specifications accordingly.<br> 
        However we can also simply just do an npm install express, that gives the necessary dependencies automatically, like stated above. <br>
        This will allow to create, request, and recieve json objects. It will allow to construct an express server.


        <ul>
            <li>const express = require("express");</li>
            <li>const fs = require("fs");</li>
            <li>const app = express();</li>
            <li>app.use(express.static("public"));</li>
            <li>app.listen(8080, () => {
                <br>
                <br>
                console.log("The server is running on port", 8080);
                <br>
                <br>
            });
        </li>
    </ul>
        <br>

        This is a basic setup to create a minimalistic server using node.js and express.js. Created a variable <b>app</b> that uses the import <b>require</b> to access express. <br>
        Along with express we also <b>require</b> filesync, which we use in conjunction with reading files, such as either properties, strings, or paths.<br> 
        We then use <b>express.static</b> to gain access to css. <br>
        We have then proceeded to assign our server to the port <b>8080</b>, which is our local server. <br>

    <h4> RESTAPI </h4>
    <p>
        An example of how to make a request to the server, and recieve a json object using a HTTP Method Get and the endpoint '/beers'. 
        <br>
        <br>
        api.get('/beers', (req, res) => {
            <br>
            <br>
            res.json(beerArray);
            <br>
            <br>
        });
    </p>
</div>

    <h4> Webpage Structure </h4>
    <p>
        To unburden the client side loadtime we instead split up our html in several pages.
