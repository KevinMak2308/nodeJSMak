            <li>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment used for executing JavaScript code outside of a web browser.</li>
            <li>Node.js is a great web framework for beginners because it works great for data-intensive applications, like streaming and real-time apps, and Node.js makes it easy to start building the back-end.</li>

            <li>Node.js allows us to use JavaScript everywhere and on any browser, including MacOS, Linux, and Windows. When we say everywhere, we mean the front-end, the middle-ware, and the back-end. Node.js is, therefore, part of some very popular web development stacks, such as the MERN stack, MEVN stack, and MEAN stack.</li>
            <li>Node.js has npm, a node package manager, with a library of over 350,000 packages to help get your project or application off the ground with efficiency and ease.</li>
